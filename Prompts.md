## Prompts for Payment Processing and Customer Service

I use **OpenAI Assistant, File Search, and API Function** (Single Agent with Tool-Calling) instead of Classifier-Based methods. Here’s why:

- **Pure OpenAI Solution:** The project leverages OpenAI’s AI Services to provide cutting-edge ChatGPT, RAG, and API functionality. This ensures seamless integration of all components, enhancing overall performance and reliability.
- **Enhanced Intelligence:** Unlike the Question Classifier + Knowledge + Chatbot approach, the Single Agent method comprehensively understands complex payment processes while integrating business logic and knowledge queries. It enables sophisticated interactions—such as changing a phone number or payment method without restarting the process; just using simple commands like "I want to change my phone number to ???" or "I want to change the payment method to a credit card.", the chatbot can handle these requests smoothly.
